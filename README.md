# Welcome to the Firebase Tutorial

This tutorial is based on the **React and Firebase Starter 💞** that we created. You can read more about it in its [readme](https://github.com/codebusters-ca/react-firebase-starter#react--firebase-starter).

## What's in It

Each branch of this repo is a tutorial that covers a certain area of Firebase development.

We recommend starting with the first branch, [`01-project-setup`](https://github.com/codebusters-ca/firebase-course/tree/01-project-setup) and building from there.

The code in each branch shows the final state of a new feature added to the app. You can learn how to build the feature by reading our [articles](https://www.codebusters.ca/articles).

## What's Next?

Head over to [`01-project-setup`](https://github.com/codebusters-ca/firebase-course/tree/01-project-setup) and follow instructions in its Readme to set up a new project with React and Firebase.
