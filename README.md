# 2 - Interacting With Firestore and Testing

This tutorial is based on a React and Firebase Starter that we created. You can read more about it in its [readme](https://github.com/codebusters-ca/react-firebase-starter#react--firebase-starter).

## Prerequisites 

In the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/codebusters-ca/firebase-course/tree/01-project-setup#1---setting-up-a-react-and-firebase-project), we set up a brand new React and Firebase app, initialized a local Firebase directory with Emulators, and connected it to a Firebase project. You need to have all of that working in order to use this branch's code.

## :warning: Some text here

Check this branch out with `git checkout 02-create-read-update`.

Install new dependencies with `cd firebase-course && npm install`.

Start Firebase Emulators with `npm run emulators`.

Then open a new terminal and start the app in development mode with `npm start`. It will open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Inside, you will find a home page and `/forms` page. Forms are the place from which the client interacts with the database. Use it to create and update a Firestore document and see the data from your Firestore displayed there.

## What's Next?

Move on to the next tutorial with `git checkout 03-test` and follow instructions in its Readme to start interacting with Firestore and testing your app.
